    Introduction

I decided to write a project on the topic of Wish List.
I used many different techniques in this project.
I will break this description into several parts: 
- Technology Stack 
- Structure description
- Notes 

      Technology Stack

In this case i use: 
  For BackEnd: 
Entity Framework, Swagger, AutoMapper, LINQ, PostgreSQL, DI(Dependency injection)

  For FrontEnd: 
ASP.NET MVC, DI(Dependency injection), JavaScript, Razor, Bootstrap, JSON

  
      Structure description

In this project, I used the "Layer separation" logic. 
For example in controllers i can use only controller logic.
I didn't write the logic of data retrieval in controllers, I brought this logic to the repository or service level.
  Logic of layers separation(numbers is level of layer):

0 Controllers
1 Controller.cs
1 Controller.cs

0 Services
1 Interfaces
2 I*Service.cs
2 I*Service.cs
1 *Service.cs
1 *Service.cs

0 Repositories
1 Interfaces
2 I*Repository.cs
2 I*Repository.cs
1 *Repository.cs
1 *Repository.cs

      Notes 

In DBcontext I configured to save DateTime automatically without having to write date and time, 
also made Id autogenerated when adding a new item to the table. 
I could have set DateTime autogeneration at the database level or in the First Migration code, 
but I decided to do it in DBcontext since another person can deploy the project at their place and 
not have to set autogeneration themselves. If this approach is wrong, please let me know!

In the API, made the output of errors in Swagger, description of endpoints. 
I used the created class "Result" and Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Swagger.
But it is good practice to write Try catch constructs rather than if else, 
but I did this so that at the Swagger level you can visually see the errors. 
Again if this is not the way to do it, please let me know !
